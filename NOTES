Multiple Widgets Having Focus at Once
	This can sometimes occur, despite the fact that is it not supposed to.
	It happens due to the following:
		The widget tree is modified, or a widget focused or de-focused. This triggers a gain/lose focus event. This event is picked up by the application which make further changes to the widget tree, or widget focus,
		This results in a focus event causing another focus event (recursive events), which results in incorrect operation, due to one event being initiated before the first is finished.
