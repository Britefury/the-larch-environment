Deleting a selection (say from a class definition body) causes a serious problem
when the start/end markers lie within the whitespace elements that do not reside
within statements, as the delete-selection mechanism misunderstands the operation
and assumes that the markers reside within the class definition header, so the
entire text of the class body is parsed as one line.
