Discovered the STEPS project, run by Alan Kay.
Looking into OMeta; the meta-language that combines pattern matching with object-orientation
with a view to describing languages.

Considering how to edit a gSym structured document.
Realised a possible link with Geoffrey Bantle's Blender Mesh system;
his system uses primitive/atomic mesh edit operations;
- make vertex, destroy vertex
  make edge, destroy edge, split edge create vertex, merge edges destroy vertex
  make face, destroy face, split face create edge, merge faces destroy edge
A similar system of atomic edits to lists could help in gSym:
- add child x
- remove child x
- replace child x with y
- split list
- merge lists
- insert range i:j
- remove range i:j
