TODOS:


COMPILER:
Major problem:
$where and $match assign variables; then delete them.
This causes a major problem;
If functions/lambdas that are defined here make use of these variables from an inner scope;
these variables would no longer be available; hence the python compiler refuses to handle this.
This is now revealed in the GLispCompiler test_Where_Lambda unit test.


	
	
	

CURSOR HANDLING SYSTEM STATUS:
The cursor handling currently uses the focus system, rather than an ever-present cursor.
It is now handled by the presentation toolkit, rather than by the document view.


ALTERNATE CURSOR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:
Implement cursor location methods for:
- DTHLine
- DTScript
- DTWrappedLine
- DTWrappedLineWithSeparators
Test cursor location methods for:
- DTBox
- DTEntry
