TODOS:



PYTHON LANGUAGE
================
Add line breaks



OPTIMISATION
============
When viewing a list, use a special form of map that applies a transformation/wrapping function, uses a filter function,
and takes the resulting element list and uses it as a list of children for a branch element. Ensure that modifications to the
underlying list result in modifications to the child list, in order to avoid rebuilding the view all over again.
