TODOS:



WHERE, IF, and LAMBDA STATEMENTS:
Each binding expression could create body-code; this needs to be interleaved correctly;
it should come just before the binding, since it may use values from previous bindings.




Cursor handling:
The cursor handling currently uses the focus system, rather than an ever-present cursor.
It is now handled by the presentation toolkit, rather than by the document view.
