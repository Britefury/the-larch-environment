TODOS:


FILE: testSource
FILE: testLanguage
FILE: metaLanguage

testSource imports testLanguage factory and asks for interface
testSource hands content to testLanguage interface, which creates testSource view

testLanguage imports metaLanguage factory and asks for interface
testSource hands content to metaLanguage interface, which creates testLanguage view

metaLanguage must create its factory, and then use this factory to create an interface
metaLanguage must hand content to the interface, so as to create a meteLanguage view



- FIx scroll-wheel zooming
- Fix the language system so that the Meta-language can display itself.
- Add filter expressions to the pattern matching system; this is going to be more complicated than I thought.
- Generate debug information for compiled code
- Handle debug information
- GLisp (compiled to Python) code can generate bad data; check the sanity before processing it
- Ensure that the build contents function can return a DVNode; if it does not generate a widget, this causes an error,
since this widget is passed straight through to the node above/outside

	
	
	

CURSOR HANDLING SYSTEM STATUS:
The cursor handling currently uses the focus system, rather than an ever-present cursor.
It is now handled by the presentation toolkit, rather than by the document view.


ALTERNATE CURSOR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:
Implement cursor location methods for:
- DTHLine
- DTScript
- DTWrappedLine
- DTWrappedLineWithSeparators
Test cursor location methods for:
- DTBox
- DTEntry
