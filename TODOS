- Computer Language Design:
  A Tutorial on Behavioral Reflection and its Implementation
  http://www2.parc.com/csl/groups/sda/projects/reflection96/docs/malenfant/ref96/ref96.html

- Add sub-match to match

- Problem: How to maintain structure
  Eg. (add (loadLocal x) (loadLocal y))
  What if (loadLocal y) is deleted?
  A good solution is to replace it with (nilExpr), rather than simply deleting the entry, in order to retain the structure
  The current system is very low-level.
  A higher level system may be required; delete/remove shouldn't simply do this; it should be the responsibility of the parent
  node to decide *how* a child is deleted (so that it can replace it, etc).
  
- Select; we need a way of specifying which node should be selected after a modification

- Queueing events needs to be handled
   - select events must occur before remaining token events




- Typesetting:
   - Add baseline alignment to DTFlow
- Document presenation toolkit:
   - Debug DTFlow
- When a parse fails, commit the unparsed text, and then try refreshing the outer expression;
  start with a[x]. Change the 'x' to 'x:2'. 'x:2' is not a valid expression.
- Check out the Psyco optimiser, since it works on Linux and Windows.
- GSym will screw up if the system attempts to render two views of the same document node:
     The pattern matcher matches a pattern
     binds one subtree to @a, the other to @b
     ($viewEval @a)
     ($viewEval @b)
     ($viewEval @a)
     Would cause an error, as the second view of @a would cause it to try to recreate the view of @a
- Use the following presentation on unicode in Python to check gSym over:
    http://farmdev.com/talks/unicode/



HANDLE/CORRECT THE FOLLOWING ERRORS IN THE VIEW:
if the view function directly returns the result of a $viewEval; a DTWidget is expected, a DVNode causes a crash


POSSIBLE COLLABORATION:

Links to information on SAGE, the CAS (computer algebra system) written in Python.
The author may be interested in the interactive typesetting system in gSym.

Sussman is workin on consistent and machine-useable notations for physics.
May be some interest in interactive typesetting.

CURSOR HANDLING SYSTEM STATUS:
The cursor handling currently uses the focus system, rather than an ever-present cursor.
It is now handled by the presentation toolkit, rather than by the document view.


ALTERNATE CURSOR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:
Implement cursor location methods for:
- DTHLine
- DTScript
- DTFlow
- DTFlowWithSeparators
Test cursor location methods for:
- DTBox
- DTEntry
