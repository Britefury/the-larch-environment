TODOS:



- Typesetting:
     - Add baseline alignment to DTWrappedLine
     - Provide different hboxes in the view code; an aligned one, and an unaligned one
- Check out the Psyco optimiser, since it works on Linux and Windows.
- GSym will screw up if the system attempts to render two views of the same document node:
     The pattern matcher matches a pattern
     binds one subtree to @a, the other to @b
     ($viewEval @a)
     ($viewEval @b)
     ($viewEval @a)
     Would cause an error, as the second view of @a would cause it to try to recreate the view of @a
- The GLisp compiler should generate memoised lambdas 
- Generate debug information for compiled code
- Handle debug information
- GLisp (compiled to Python) code can generate bad data; check the sanity before processing it
- Ensure that the build contents function can return a DVNode; if it does not generate a widget, this causes an error,
since this widget is passed straight through to the node above/outside


	
	
	

CURSOR HANDLING SYSTEM STATUS:
The cursor handling currently uses the focus system, rather than an ever-present cursor.
It is now handled by the presentation toolkit, rather than by the document view.


ALTERNATE CURSOR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:
Implement cursor location methods for:
- DTHLine
- DTScript
- DTWrappedLine
- DTWrappedLineWithSeparators
Test cursor location methods for:
- DTBox
- DTEntry
