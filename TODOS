TODOS:



EMACS CONTROLS
==========
Emacs navigation



QUERY LANGUAGE
===========
Tie in with emacs navigation



PARAGRAPH LINE BREAKS
==========
Line breaks break the most convenient element. This looks bad in the case of:
f(a, b, c, d, e(x, y))
The break after the 'x,' is activated. It would be more appropriate to activate the one
after 'd,'.
Line breaks should respect nested structures.



PYTHON LANGUAGE
================
Handle print statements properly

View configuration; spacing, etc

Importer; handle comments that appear after code; on the same line



OPTIMISATION
============
When viewing a list, use a special form of map that applies a transformation/wrapping function, uses a filter function,
and takes the resulting element list and uses it as a list of children for a branch element. Ensure that modifications to the
underlying list result in modifications to the child list, in order to avoid rebuilding the view all over again.



ELEMENT TREE SUPPORT FOR TABLE WIDGET
======================================
Add element tree support for the table widget



PARSER DEBUG VIEWER BNF VIEW
============================
Add BNF visualisation to the parser debug viewer.



SELECTION
=========
Handle replace selection.



CUT AND PASTE
=============
Handle cut and paste



SEQUENCE VIEWS
==============
Add support for other kinds of sequence view (vertical, table, etc)



JAVA LANGUAGE
==============
Complete Java language support
