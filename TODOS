TODOS:



- The GLisp compiler should generate memoised lambdas 
- Generate debug information for compiled code
- Handle debug information
- GLisp (compiled to Python) code can generate bad data; check the sanity before processing it
- Ensure that the build contents function can return a DVNode; if it does not generate a widget, this causes an error,
since this widget is passed straight through to the node above/outside

	
	
	

CURSOR HANDLING SYSTEM STATUS:
The cursor handling currently uses the focus system, rather than an ever-present cursor.
It is now handled by the presentation toolkit, rather than by the document view.


ALTERNATE CURSOR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:
Implement cursor location methods for:
- DTHLine
- DTScript
- DTWrappedLine
- DTWrappedLineWithSeparators
Test cursor location methods for:
- DTBox
- DTEntry
