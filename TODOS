CURSOR HANDLING SYSTEM STATUS:
The cursor handling currently uses the focus system, rather than an ever-present cursor.
It is now handled by the presentation toolkit, rather than by the document view.


ALTERNATE CURSOR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:
Implement cursor location methods for:
- DTHLine
- DTScript
- DTWrappedLine
- DTWrappedLineWithSeparators
Test cursor location methods for:
- DTBox
- DTEntry
